You can specify your build instructions in the distelli-manifest.yml file in the PreRelease section. For more information on the distelli-manifest.yml see [Distelli Manifest](doc:distelli-manifest).

<h3><a name="customizing-the-build"></a>Customizing the Build</h3>

A build is typically made up of the following steps:
<ol>
<li>[Install](#Install): Install any dependencies required for the next 2 steps.</li>
<li>[Build](#build): Run the build script.</li>
<li>[Test](#test): Run tests.</li>
</ol>
Here is an example PreRelease section of a distelli-manifest.yml:

{{< callout-code >}}
PreRelease:\n - echo \---Begin PreRelease---\\n \n - echo \---Install dependencies---\\n - sudo apt-get -y update\n - sudo apt-get -y install nodejs\n - sudo apt-get -y install npm\n \n - echo \---Build application---\\n - sudo npm install\n \n - echo \---Run tests---\\n - npm test
{{< /callout-code >}}

{
"type": "basic",
"title": "Install"
}
[/block]
There are no default install steps. They are customizable. Enter the commands, specific to the operating system being built on, to install any dependencies.
For more information see [Installing Dependencies](doc:installing-dependencies).

<h3><a name="build"></a>Build</h3>

There are no default build steps. They are customizable. Enter the commands specific the application being built, compiled, linked, etc...

<h3><a name="test"></a>Test</h3>

<br>
When doing a ```distelli push``` you can provide textual release notes.
These instructions are specific to creating release notes when creating a new release. If you want to add release notes to an existing release see [Editing Release Notes](doc:editing-release-notes).
You can create release notes when doing a ```distelli push``` from:
<ul>
<li>[The command line](#create-release-notes-from-cli).</li>
<li>[The Distelli manifest ReleaseNotesCmd](#create-release-notes-from-manifest).</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="create-release-notes-from-cli"></a>Create Release Notes from CLI</h3>

When pushing a new release to a Distelli account you can use the option ```--release-notes```.

{{< callout-code >}}
distelli push --release-notes
{{< /callout-code >}}

Here is an example session:

{{< callout-code >}}
$ distelli push --release-notes\nEnter Release Notes (Ctrl-D to Finish):\n\nThis release fixes issues found in the following bugs:\n</i> Bug #4373\n</i> Bug #4201\n</i> Bug #3293\n\n Packaged 1 files in 1 directories\n Pushing App: SimpleApp\n Uploading Bundle: [=========] 100%\n \n Creating Release... DONE\n Uploading Release Notes... DONE
{{< /callout-code >}}

For more information on pushing releases see [Distelli CLI](doc:distelli-cli#push)

<h3><a name="create-release-notes-from-manifest"></a>Create Release Notes from Manifest</h3>

You can automate the creation of release notes with the Distelli manifest ReleaseNotesCmd section. This step occurs during a ```distelli push``` after the ```PreRelease``` section. If using builds on Distelli, this step occurs after the build and test have completed successfully. This step will occur on the build server.
An example manifest with ReleaseNotesCmd:

{{< callout-code >}}
ReleaseNotesCmd:\n - echo \Application X Release Notes\\n - echo \===========================\\n - echo \\\n - 'hg log -l 10 -b default'

Using Distelli you can provision EC2 instances (servers) and have them immediately available for deploys and builds.

{{% callout-danger %}}
Provisioning and launching EC2 instances may incur charges on your Amazon AWS account
{{% /callout-danger %}}


<h3><a name="provision-an-ec2-instance"></a>Provision an EC2 Instance</h3>

<ol>
<li>Click the <b>Servers</b> link at the top of the Distelli WebUI.</li>
<li>Click the <b>New Server</b> button at the top right.</li>
</ol>
This will begin the new server workflow.
<li>Click the <b>Launch an EC2 Instance</b> button.</li>
<li>Enter your EC2 credential</li>
</ol>
For more information on setting up your Amazon Access Key see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSGettingStartedGuide/AWSCredentials.html" target="_blank">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSGettingStartedGuide/AWSCredentials.html</a>.

{{% callout-danger %}}
Ensure the AWS user has the correct permission policy applied that allows the user to create EC2 instances. If the credentials do not have EC2 permissions you will get an \Invalid Credentials\ error message in Distelli.
{{% /callout-danger %}}

<li>Choose your instance type from the list of possible instances.</li>
<li>Choose your OS Image.</li>
<li>Choose your Virtual Private Cloud (vpc).</li>
<li>Chose your subnet</li>
</ol>

{{% callout-danger %}}
The EC2 instance you provision must have Internet access. This is easy to provision by ensuring your subnet provides an associated public IP address. For more information see <a href=\http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-ip-addressing.html target=\_blank\>http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-ip-addressing.html</a>.
{{% /callout-danger %}}

<li> Choose your security group.</li>
<li> Click <b>Done</b>.</li>
<li> Select the number of EC2 instances you wish to provision.</li>
</ol>

{{% callout-danger %}}
Remember, provisioning EC2 servers may incur charges.
{{% /callout-danger %}}

Your instances are being provisioned.
<li> Click <b>Go to Servers</b> button.</li>
</ol>

{{% callout-warning %}}
EC2 instances take a bit of time to completely provision (come up) and communicate on the Internet. Be patient. If you are waiting more than 10 minutes, there may be a problem. Are you sure the subnet you chose provides Internet access to the instance?

This document discusses using the Distelli CLI to push your application. For information on using Distelli's continuous integration (CI) features see [Overview of CI/CD with Distelli](doc:overview-of-cicd-with-distelli).
You must push an application to Distelli to create a release for deployment.
When [integrating with a repository](doc:connecting-a-repository-to-an-application) a push is initiated by the build server. A release is created after successful builds and tests.

<h3><a name="push-a-release"></a>Push a Release</h3>

To push a release of an application you must use the [Distelli CLI](doc:distelli-cli). First make sure you are logged into the CLI by using the ```distelli login``` command.

{{< callout-code >}}
$ distelli login\n\nEmail: jdoe@distelli.com\nPassword:
{{< /callout-code >}}


{{< callout-code >}}
jdoe@HostA:~/SimpleApp$ distelli push\n Packaged 1 files in 1 directories\n Pushing App: SimpleApp\n Uploading Bundle: [==========] 100%\n\n Creating Release... DONE
{{< /callout-code >}}

{
"type": "basic",
"title": "Details of a Push"
}
[/block]
When doing a ```distelli push``` the following occurs:
<ul>
<li>The distelli CLI will open and look in the distelli-manifest.yml.</li>
<li>Any steps specified in the [PreRelease](doc:distelli-manifest#prerelease) section will be executed</li>
<li>The manifest [PkgInclude](doc:distelli-manifest#pkginclude) and [PkgExclude](doc:distelli-manifest#pkgexclude) sections will define what, if any, files to bundle into the release.</li>
<li>The release files will be tar'd and gzip'd into a [bundle](doc:distelli-bundle-1).</li>
<li>The bundle will be uploaded to the distelli account or the [configured AWS S3](doc:using-amazon-s3-bucket) bucket securely.</li>
<li>The application release number will be incremented.</li>
<li>A new release will be created.</li>
<li>Who created the release will be tracked.</li>
<li>When the release was created will be tracked.</li>
</ul>
You can see the Release in the Distelli WebUI under the application. Or you can use the [Distelli CLI list](doc:distelli-cli#list) command to list the release.

Servers, in Distelli, are used for deployments and builds.
A server is either a physical or a virtual machine instance running a single copy of an OS, which we identify via a unique host name. These servers may, for example, be on your desktop, in a co-location facility or somewhere in the cloud.
