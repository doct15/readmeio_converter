There are several steps that must be completed before beginning any of the tutorials.

As noted above, you should first walk through the basic getting started example to familiarize you with the Distelli concepts. As a reminder here is a picture.

Before you begin the tutorials you must:
* Install the Distelli CLI on the Development System. [Installing the CLI](doc:installing-the-cli) 
* Ensure git is installed on the Development System. <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">Download git</a>
* Have a Destination Server available to deploy software to. [Building Virtual Servers](doc:building-virtual-servers) 
* Install the Distelli Agent on the Destination Server. [Installing the Agent](doc:installing-the-agent) 

Once you have completed the above steps, you can successfully progress through the tutorials.
