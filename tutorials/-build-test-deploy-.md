The build, test, and deploy tutorials are designed to take a language specific application in a public repository through to deployment. This exemplifies setting up continuous deployment with Distelli.

For more information on continuous deployment see [Overview of CI/CD with Distelli](doc:overview-of-cicd-with-distelli).

To start one of the build, test, and deploy tutorials select the language specific tutorial from the list on the left.

You can also peruse the tutorials in the [Tutorials Index](doc:tutorials-index).
