Distelli is a deployment platform that is available as SaaS (Software as a Service). 

Distelli can deploy to any server in any environment. With a few simple steps you can setup any server and deploy your application code, databases or config files, view an audit trail of previous deployments, or rollback to a previous known good version. Distelli makes it easy to integrate your deployments with your development workflow and enables you and your teams to iterate fast on the build, deploy, and test cycle. 

Distelli works seamlessly with any server in public and private clouds or servers in a private datacenter allowing you to focus on your applications and software.

Distelli is your all in one continuous deployment (CD) solution.

Build has often referred either to the process of converting source code files into standalone software artifact(s) that can be run on a computer (server), or the result of doing so.

The build process may include code compilation, linking, and/or tests. In Distelli, a successfully completed build creates a Distelli application release.

Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository periodically. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.

After a successful build and testing it is typical to want to deploy the software to a group of servers. At Distelli, we group servers into "environments", for example; "Staging".

Deployment of software entails copying the appropriate files to the destination server, coordinating any dependencies, and launching the software.

Distelli automates this process.

Continuous Delivery (CD) is a software engineering approach in which teams keep producing valuable software in short cycles and ensure that the software can be reliably released at any time. It is used in software development to automate and improve the process of software delivery.

Typically continuous deliver is the act of taking the successfully built software package and deploying it to a staging (non-production) environment of servers.

Continuous Deployment (CD) takes the next step and automates the process of deploying the code to production.
