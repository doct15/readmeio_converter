The build log contains useful information related to your build. It is also invaluable in troubleshooting. You can provide a link to a specific line in the build log.

The build log can be found on the build page. To navigate to a build page:
1. Click **Builds** at the top of the Distelli WebUI.
2. Click on a build to see the associated log.

In the build log, on the right is a sequence of line numbers. Each of these is an anchor link to that specific line that can be copied and shared with others.
