The build process is one of the first steps in continuous integration and continuous deployment. Distelli can build applications from your repositories and auto build them either using Distelli build servers or your build servers.

To get started with auto builds see:
* [Enabling Auto Build](doc:enabling-auto-build).
* [Creating an Application from a Repository](doc:creating-an-application-from-a-repository).
* [Connecting a Repository to an Application](doc:connecting-a-repository-to-an-application).
