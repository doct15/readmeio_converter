When a build of an application is done, a notification event occurs. This event can trigger a customized notification that you can configure. For more information on notification types see [Types of Notifications](doc:types-of-notifications).

This event occurs whether the build was triggered manually or automatically. This event occurs whether the build is on Distelli servers or on your server(s).

}
[/block]
