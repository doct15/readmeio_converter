Github is a software repository hosting service that provides revision control and source code management.

Integrating Github with Distelli provides continuous integration and continuous deployment. For more information see [Overview of CI/CD with Distelli](doc:overview-of-cicd-with-distelli).

With Github integration you can create applications in Distelli from a Github repository and enable auto-builds when a change is checked into the repository.

Before beginning ensure you are using the correct team or individual account in Distelli. For more information see [Using a Team](doc:using-a-team).

To enable Github integration, follow these steps.

1. In the Distelli WebUI click the **gear** icon at the top right.
2. Click the **Integrations** link on the left.
3. Click the **Github** button.
4. Click the **Connect Github Account** button.

At this point, your browser will be directed to Gibhub for you to authorize Distelli. If you are not already logged into Gibhub, you will be prompted to.
