Some interactions with Distelli teams requires you know the username of the team. For example creating an application in a team.

}

1. Ensure you are [signed in](signing-in-to-distelli) to the Distelli WebUI.
2. On the top right, hover your mouse over the word **Owner**.
[block:callout]
{
  "type": "warning",
  "body": "If you are currently in a team view, the word Owner will be replaced by the **team name**. Hover over that."
}
[/block]
When hovering you will see a drop down that reveals the username/teamname.
