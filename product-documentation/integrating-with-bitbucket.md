Bitbucket is a software repository hosting service that provides revision control.

Integrating Github with Distelli provides continuous integration and continuous deployment. For more information see [Overview of CI/CD with Distelli](doc:overview-of-cicd-with-distelli).


With Bitbucket integration you can create applications in Distelli from a Bitbucket repository and enable auto-builds when a change is checked into the repository.
