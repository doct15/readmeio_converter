The application you just deployed is a simple web server operating at port 3000.
[block:api-header]
{
  "type": "basic",
  "title": "Validate"
}
[/block]
This step will require you know the address to your destination server that the application was deployed to.

In your browser open a link to your server:
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "http://YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS:3000",
      "language": "text"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
You should see a message from Distelli.
[block:api-header]
{
  "type": "basic",
  "title": "Next"
}
[/block]
