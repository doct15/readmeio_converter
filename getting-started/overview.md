Distelli is a complete deployment platform that's easy to setup and use. With a few simple steps you can setup any server, build, test, and deploy your application code, databases or config files, view an audit trail of previous deployments, or rollback to a previous known good version. Distelli makes it easy to integrate your deployments with your development workflow and enables you and your teams to iterate fast on the build, deploy, and test cycle. Distelli works seamlessly with any server in public and private clouds or servers in a private datacenter, allowing you to focus on your applications and software.
